I'm a student of minority descent and I want to understand what my options are for funding my education. I'm trying to eliminate the mistakes when I apply for the financial assistance I need. But it's complicated, unfamiliar and unclear because I have no prior experience with the process of applying which makes me feel discouraged, frustrated and overwhelmed.
